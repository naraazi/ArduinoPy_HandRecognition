# Number of Fingers Recognition Using Arduino
Access the original repository [here](https://github.com/Chando0185/led_controller_python_arduino).

## Original Repository
The original code uses the **pyfirmata** library. The problem is that the Arduino board is doing nothing but accepting
the signals.

I wanted to compile something on the Arduino itself, so I used the **pyserial** library.

## This Repository
Here we have the original project with troubleshooting and some details about its execution.

Additionally, we have the **pyserial** code with some execution details (this includes the code for the Arduino board).
